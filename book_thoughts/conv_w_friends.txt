Chapter 1
Bobbi seems very conceited 
Frances is a try hard, but almost self-aware
Chapter 2
Already enjoying the self conscious style of Frances 
Bobbi seems a cunt
Chapter 3
Is a love like pentagon gonna form? 
Enjoying the easy reading style
Frances’ observant nature is depressant 
Chapter 4
Really like Frances, self-conscious style is compelling 
The comment about trying drugs is interesting
Chapter 5
Weird kinship with Frances 
Is she a narcissist? Sociopath? 
“Lacked a ‘real personality’ the same way I did”
“My ego had always been an issue”
Chapter 6
So the point is that Bobbi is an insufferable twat? 
The mum seems a bit off
Strange comment “felt like harming myself” 
Chapter 7
Philip seems to have disappeared
Chapter 8 
Very tense chapter 
Will they won’t they
Chapter 9
So they will
Finding the speech writing style a bit difficult 
Nick is a bit weird, after what seemed like a bit of an argument we was more into it? 
Chapter 10
That chapter was very heavy with self loathing
Oh woe is me bullshit — makes me like Frances’ character less
Chapter 11
First really visual chapter
Dream effectively about drowning 
Chapter 12 
Frances is less self loathing now 
Makes a better read
Chapter 13 
Are they gonna get caught shagging by the wife?
Chapter 14 
The book is a lot more interesting when Frances is in a good mood 
Nick’s depression was very obvious
Chapter 15 
Fuck Bobbi is such a cunt! 
Frances is a very dramatic character 
People should just be honest
Did she confuse lust for love? 
Chapter 16
Still don’t like Frances way of rationalising Nick’s feelings for her and Melissa
This is feeling a bit like a airport novel for the Instagram generation 
Chapter 17
Pointless making a scene
Frances is depressed
Maybe I am quick to diagnose 
Chapter 18
That was a good chapter
First one in a while
I enjoyed her reaction to “being pregnant”
Chapter 19
Did I miss the bit about Nick not wanting to wear a condom?
Christ Bobbi is really insufferable 
The dad is dead?
Chapter 20
Dad isn’t dead
Why would she live with Bobbi
Quite mundane
