Is this a collection of short stories or a book?

### Thoughts

- Really nice read, very well written. 
- Started to feel a bit like a M Creative Arts thesis project. e.g. significant changes in writing style, narrator orientation (Out of Body & Great Rock and Roll Pauses by Alison Blake)
- Loved the Selling the General chapter.
